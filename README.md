# mexoscope

This is Bram de Jong's classic **mexoscope** plug-in with the source code cleaned up, documented, and modernized for JUCE 8.

![mexoscope](Docs/oscilloscope_full.png)

The original smartelectronix site is defunct now but Bram was kind enough to upload [his plug-in source code](https://github.com/bdejong/smartelectronix/tree/master) to GitHub.

This version is based on [Armando Montanez's JUCE port](https://github.com/armandomontanez/mexoscope) from 2016 and [Jason Perez's fixes](https://github.com/jasonmarkperez/mexoscope-mac). However, I changed almost everything. :smile:

See also [my blog post](https://audiodev.blog/mexoscope/) about this plug-in.

## How to use this plug-in

[Read the manual](Docs/Manual.md) (original by Kerrydan)

Notes:

* The External trigger mode is not implemented in this version.
* The docs mention a "modular" version but only the standard version is available.

## Building from source code

### Projucer

Brief instructions:

* Install JUCE 8 or newer.
* Open **mexoscope.jucer** in Projucer and export to your IDE.
* Select the **VST3** or **AU** target and build.

## To-do list

* \[x] Improve drawing. Stuff seems to be off by a few pixels.
* \[x] Provide binaries so you don't have to compile this from scratch.
* \[ ] Dark mode. Bram's repo has dark mode images so why not use them!
* \[ ] Click on the text for the AMP knob to switch between linear and decibel display.
* \[ ] Make the INTERNAL TRIG SPEED knob independent of the sample rate.
* \[ ] Instead of simply clipping samples that go outside of visible range, show them in red to indicate they've been clipped.
* \[ ] Use a path to draw the interpolated lines instead of doing the interpolation manually.
* \[ ] Don't store two Point objects per pixel but use a custom struct.
* \[ ] Make thread-safe. The `peaks` array is written to by the audio code and read from the UI thread.
* \[ ] Retina/HiDPI graphics. Resizable UI.

From the original `todo.txt`:

```text
[TODO]
* stereo (left/right/both on display, trigger=left) [Ross Bencina]
* VST programs [AFH]
* editable default settings (think bidule / save as default / registry) [AFH]
```

Mexoscope is not an effect, nor is it a synthesiser, don't
expect it to generate noise: it's a visualisation only plugin!

Useful for looking at waveforms and very useful for developers.

For more info, see the splendid documentation by Kerrydan.

have fun,
